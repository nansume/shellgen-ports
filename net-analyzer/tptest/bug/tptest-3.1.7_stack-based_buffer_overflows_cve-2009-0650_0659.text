   Description Robert Buchholz (RETIRED) [bugs-rank-dev.png] 2009-03-04 16:58:41 UTC

   CVE-2009-0650 (http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2009-0650):
     Stack-based buffer overflow in the GetStatsFromLine function in
     TPTEST 3.1.7 and earlier, and possibly 5.02, allows remote attackers
     to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute
     arbitrary code via a STATS line with a long pwd field.  NOTE: some of
     these details are obtained from third party information.

   CVE-2009-0659 (http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2009-0659):
     Stack-based buffer overflow in the GetStatsFromLine function in
     TPTEST 3.1.7 allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via a
     STATS line with a long email field.  NOTE: the provenance of this
     information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third
     party information.

   Proposed patch to fix the vulnerabilities in the GetStatsFromLine function in tpcommon.c.

   This patch fixes the vulnerability due to strcpy, as well as a couple other potential issues.
