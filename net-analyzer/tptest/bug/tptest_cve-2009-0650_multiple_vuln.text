   Description: From the CVE entries:

                Stack-based buffer overflow in the GetStatsFromLine function in TPTEST 3.1.7 and earlier, and
                possibly 5.02, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly
                execute arbitrary code via a STATS line with a long pwd field. NOTE: some of these details are
                obtained from third party information. (CVE-2009-0650)

                Stack-based buffer overflow in the GetStatsFromLine function in TPTEST 3.1.7 allows remote attackers
                to have an unknown impact via a STATS line with a long email field. NOTE: the provenance of this
                information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information. (CVE-2009-0659)
