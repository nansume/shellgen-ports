[warn] Your Guard DefinitelyNotTheFBI ($A1B2C3FA4B5C6FA7B8C9F0) is failing a very large amount of circuits.

Most likely this means the Tor network is overloaded,
 but it could also mean an attack against you or potentially the guard itself.

Success counts are 100/400. Use counts are 50/100. 400 circuits completed,
 2 were unusable, 200 collapsed, and 300 timed out.

For reference, your timeout cutoff is 60 seconds.
