                               Building QtWebKit on Linux - qtwebkit/qtwebkit GitHub Wiki

   You need to install the next dependencies:

     * Qt >= 5.4 (Core, Gui, Network, Sql, OpenGL, Test, Widgets, Positioning, Sensors)

          * For QML API: Declarative, WebChannel (or you can disable it with -DENABLE_WEBKIT2=OFF cmake flag)

     * CMake >= 2.8.12 (>= 3.2 is recommended)
     * ninja
     * sqlite >= 3.6.16
     * ICU >= 52.1
     * ruby >= 1.9
     * perl >= 5.10.0
     * python 2.7.x
     * bison >= 2.1
     * flex >= 2.5.34
     * gperf >= 3.0.1
     * libxml2 >= 2.8.0 (2.6.x will probably work)
     * libxslt >= 1.1.7
     * libjpeg v8 or v9 (IJG) or libjpeg-turbo
     * libpng
     * zlib
     * libhyphen
     * glib >= 2.36 (gio, gobject)
     * gstreamer >= 1.0.3 (app, pbutils, video, mpegts, tag, audio, fft); you also need GStreamer 1.0 plugins for
       codec support

   Optional dependencies:

     * fontconfig
     * libwebp

   > Q: Why do you have so many dependencies?

   > A: See FAQ

   For Ubuntu >= 18.04 use the following command:

 sudo apt-get build-dep libqt5webkit5

   For development, install these additional dependencies:

 sudo apt-get libgcrypt11-dev libtasn1-6-dev

   For Fedora >= 30 use the following command:

 sudo dnf install qt5-devel cmake ninja-build sqlite-devel libicu-devel ruby perl bison flex gperf libxml-devel libxslt-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel libpng-devel zlib-devel hyphen-devel glib2-devel gstreamer1-devel qt5 qt5-qtbase-private-devel

   You can then build QtWebKit with cmake:

 mkdir -p WebKitBuild/Release
 cd WebKitBuild/Release
 cmake -DPORT=Qt -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..
 make -jN # Replace N with number of your CPU cores
 sudo make install

   If you are not using system-wide installation of Qt, you should add -DQt5_DIR=$your_Qt_path/lib/cmake/Qt5 to cmake
   arguments, e.g.

 cmake -DPORT=Qt -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
     -DQt5_DIR=/opt/Qt5.8.0/5.8/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt5 ../..

   or

 cmake -DPORT=Qt -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
     -DQt5_DIR=/usr/local/Qt-5.11.0/lib/cmake/Qt5 ../..

   Note: this manual previously suggested using CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, but it may cause build errors related to
   misdetection of ICU libraries with Qt SDK 5.8.0 and 5.9.0

  Cross-compilation

   Cross-compilation with CMake is described in official CMake documentation. Basically, you need CMake toolchain
   file (for example, see ToolchainMIPS.cmake in the root of this repository), and all required dependencies compiled
   for your target. In order to reduce number of dependencies, you may want to disable some features.

  Building for running test suite

   If you're contributing to QtWebKit, optionally run the Tools/Scripts/update-qtwebkit-libs script (see JHBuild) to
   build all dependencies inside the source tree, in order to get reproducible test results. Then use the
   build-webkit script to get separate debug/release builds:

 Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --qt --release  # or --debug

  Installation

   Currently you have to install QtWebKit in order to build your applications against it. Installation prefix is
   controlled by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable, you may even set it to your Qt prefix (warning: it will replace
   existing QtWebKit files if you have one installed!).

   Run the following command to perform installation:

 cd WebKitBuild/Release && sudo make install

   or if you build with ninja (default behavior of build-webkit, if ninja is installed):

 cd WebKitBuild/Release && sudo ninja install

   (Note that you don't need sudo if you are installing into user-writable location)

  Installation Troubleshoot

   If you are building with ninja and see error like this:

 CMake Error at Source/WebKit/cmake_install.cmake:129 (FILE):
   file INSTALL cannot find
   "/mnt/ssd2/WebKit/WebKit-new-qt-stable/WebKitBuild/Release/Source/WebKit/CMakeFiles/CMakeRelink.dir/libQt5WebKitWidgets.so.5.602.1".
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   Source/cmake_install.cmake:94 (INCLUDE)
   cmake_install.cmake:37 (INCLUDE)

   run the next command:

 sed -ie 's|Source/WebKit/CMakeFiles/CMakeRelink\.dir|lib|' Source/WebKit/cmake_install.cmake
 sed -ie 's|Source/WebKit/qt/declarative/CMakeFiles/CMakeRelink\.dir|imports/QtWebKit|' Source/WebKit/qt/declarative/cmake_install.cmake
 sed -ie 's|Source/WebKit/qt/declarative/experimental/CMakeFiles/CMakeRelink\.dir|imports/QtWebKit/experimental|' Source/WebKit/qt/declarative/experimental/cmake_install.cmake

   Another solution is building with CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH=ON, but in this case binaries won't run before
   installation without setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  Building only JSC

   To build only JSC, replace build-webkit with build-jsc

   Use this command to run JSC tests:

 Tools/Scripts/run-layout-jsc -t LayoutTests/ -j build/qt-jsc/Release/bin/jsc -r results
